# PetClinicManagementSystem

The Pet Clinic Management System is a Java object-oriented, console-based application that allows users to manage information about pets in a clinic.
It allows adding, deleting, modifying, deleting, searching, and displaying all pets, as well as saving and loading data from files for persistent storage.
This project was developed as a part of my first-year Object-Oriented Programming coursework, which demonstrates key Java concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and file I/O handling.

Key Features:
Add Pets: Add a new Dog or Cat record with details like name, age, colour, weight and breed.
Delete Pets: Remove an existing pet from clinic records.
Modify Pets: Update an existing pet's information.
Display All Pets: View all pets registered with the clinic and display their details.
Display a Report: Shows the total number of cats and dogs in the clinic, as well as the most common colour.
Search Pets: Search for a pet within the clinic, and return its details
File Management: Save and load clinic data using text files.

Object-Oriented Principles Demonstrated:
Encapsulation:Pet attributes are protected through controlled access
Inheritance: Cat and Dog subclasses inherit shared fields and methods from the Pet superclass
Polymorphism:ArrayList stores different pet types and methods, the program automatically runs the correct subclass version.
